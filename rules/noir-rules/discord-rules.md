# Discord Rules

**Prime Servers and Channels**

* No excess unnecessary pings to any individual or ghost pings.
* Don't create drama/conflict or argue with other members in any of the server discussion channels, create a ticket or take personal matters to DMs.
* Do not post real people getting killed in any channel.
* Only @ Staff if there is an emergency on the server. Otherwise, make a ticket.
* No extremely loud mics within RTO or any Voice Channels.
* Don't play any “ear rape” music using the music bots.
* No mic spam in any voice channel.
* Don’t use the music bot in any emergency channel.
* Radio clicks or anything similar is not allowed within RTO.
* If you tag alerted, you will be permanently muted.
* Do not share other people’s personal information or photos without permission.

#### **Advertising**

* You may DM your friends a link to another server only if they ASK first.
  * If you bring up the server first and then they ask for the link to join, you are still subject to punishment.
* DMing people with links to other servers will result in an immediate ban.
* Do not post URL links to other FiveM Discord Servers in any chat. This is considered an advertisement and will result in an immediate ban.
* You may not use the “Custom Status” feature as a method to promote another Discord Server or FiveM Server which is unaffiliated with Prime. If you are advertising with a link, you will be subject to an immediate ban.

#### **Direct Messages**

* We don’t issue punishments/take interest in DMs or things within other servers that aren't part of Prime. _However, sharing other people’s personal info or threatening the Prime server in any way; these 2 things will result in an instant perma-ban with no discussion._
