* Departments are only allowed to promote an individual a maximum of 2 ranks per week.
* If you have a problem with a department, you are to go to \#make-a-ticket channel in Discord in order to get a proper hearing from staff members.
* You may only transfer to another department with permission from a high command from your current department. _When transferring to another department, you will always start at the lowest rank within that department. You are not allowed to transfer for higher status within that department and/or for easier promotions._
* Rule per department, discord nicknames must consist of your in-game characters first initial and last name. Ex. B. Stephens
