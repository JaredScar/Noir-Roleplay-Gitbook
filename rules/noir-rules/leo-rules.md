# LEO Rules

* Law Enforcement Officers \(LEOs\) must declare LOA from their department before going on as Civilian unless they have clocked in at least 1 hour a day.
* While in RTO, you may not speak out of RP.  Do not talk over other officers and never join RTO if you are off-duty.  
* Outfits from the EUP menu cannot be claimed for one particular department/high command. The EUP menu is permitted to be used by all.
* Vehicles added in-game cannot be claimed for one particular department/high command. So long as the vehicle is marked for the department, all members of the department must be able to achieve a rank status high enough to be able to drive it. There will be no "High Command only vehicles"...
* You cannot drive/use a marked police vehicle or a vehicle with red and blue lights when off duty.
* The /jail command may not be used to give excessive jail time or stop another player from breaking the rules. 
  * Breaking this rule can result in up to a 72-hour temporary ban.
* Sub-Divisions and Departments may put their own rules in place. These will usually be posted within the Discord and they must be followed as if they were written in this document.
