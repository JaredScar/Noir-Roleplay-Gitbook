# FiveM Rules

#### **In-Game Actions**

* No VDM \(Vehicle Death Match\) or RDM \(Random Death Match\). Which is classified as unjustified RP based on the actions of others. You cannot just go up to a person and shoot them in the head or run them over with your car for fun.
  * Mass RDM/VDM are punishable by a 72 hour temporary ban or permanent ban depending on severity.
  * If you are being RDM‚Äôd or VDM‚Äôd, do NOT try to get revenge. Report the player and ignore them or you may be subject to the same punishment.
* No cop baiting. This means that if you are purposely doing an illegal activity in front of an LEO to get them to respond, it can lead to you being punished.  Think of a realistic way to start RP scenarios.
* Permanently killing a character MUST be agreed by BOTH parties.
* If you RP suicide using, for example, cyanide pills. Your character is permanently dead.
* Utilities that are not in the game such as flashbangs, smoke grenades, etc. cannot be used via /me or /do. 
* Terrorist RP is permitted but it must be tasteful.  Simply screaming racist slurs and blowing one's self up will not be tolerated.  If you would like to take the time to create a terrorist call, you may do so but you may not act on stereotypes for terrorism. Make sure your acts are well planned out and there are plenty of officers online to respond to any act you commit.
* RP as if you fear for your life. For example, if you are a hostage in a bank robbery, do what the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù asks.  Do not do anything that could lead to getting yourself killed unless it is something your character would actually do.
* You can only run from cops if you have an active warrant and/or valid reason.
  * Running from the cops for "going 5 over" is not a valid reason.
  * Running from the cops because you "felt like it" is also not a valid reason.
  * _Alternatively, if you would like to run from the cops without one of the reasons specified above, you may ask the cop in /ooc if he would like a 10-80. If he accepts, only then can you RP a 10-80 out without meeting the above criteria previously described._
* You must wear realistic clothing, you're not allowed to wear full body armour unless it is apart of your roleplay and you're in a situation where it is needed. (This does not apply for LEO or SANG)
* You're not allowed to drive any sort of armoured vehicle(s) unless you're active SRT/SWAT or active NG.
* You're not allowed to do excessive criminal rp, this means you're not allowed to rob banks, rob people, shoot cops, run from cops excessively. You will be punished based off the discretion of staff.
* You're not allowed to do excessive gun rp, this means you're not allowed to do an excessive amount of gun rp related scenario's, you will be punished based off the discretion of staff.
* You must keep every RP scenario realistic, you must not do things you would not do or see in real life use your best judgement when creating/doing RP scenario's.
* You're not allowed to use planes or helicopters as an advantage to run from the police, you will be punished based off the discretion of staff.
* 



#### **Gang Rules**
* Follow all rules in #üìårules.
* Do not begin a gang war without both sides agreeing. - See rule 6 
* No KOS without both sides agreeing, if you are told to stop KOS or one side wants to stop, you stop. [KOS may only be active for 10 minutes and cannot be done during priority cooldown.]
* Gangs still need to respect the LEO's and should not do excessive gun RP.
* One gang cannot be immune from one gang, if you want to be immune to a gang you may RP an alliance.
* One gang cannot begin a gang war on another gang for no reason, it must be mutually agreed or initiated by one side, for example a kidnapping of one of the members, in this case the gang can retaliate, but must be reasonable. [Do not just snipe the gang from far away unless they are going to kill your kidnapped member, or are torturing them. Do a /me in chat to indicate what you are doing]. This also stops misidentification, both sides must know who is involved in the gang war.
* Meta game will result in your gang being suspended for a week, if this goes further you may be blacklisted from owning a gang.
* Excessive gun RP will also result in a warning or a suspension. [This also goes for any Fail RP]

*Gang wars and 10 minute KOS cannot be an RDM fest, it must be under control at all times and must not disturb other players on the server, after 10 minutes you must not initiate another KOS for 24 hours. During the KOS period, drive bys, snipings and other things alike will be allowed but must still be RP'd with /me, for example: /me grabs sniper and aims at other gang. Do not treat KOS like GTA Online.*




#### **Restricted Areas/Locations**

* Gang headquarters may only be raided or taken over when the gang is active.
* Coast Guard and Military ships cannot be boarded if you are attempting a raid \(this applies to the USS Iowa. USS Missouri, and USS Fletcher\). Realistically, these ships would have a crew with thousands of members... We don't have that kind of population on the server sadly... You may attack the Military, but you cannot board the ship unless there are 5+ active Military personnel on the ship.
* Fort Zancudo cannot be entered if you are attempting a raid.  Realistically, this base would have thousands of Active Duty members‚Ä¶ We don‚Äôt have that kind of population on the server sadly‚Ä¶ You may attack the National Guard, but you cannot raid the base unless there are 5+ active National Guard members on the base.

#### **Abusing Permissions, Bugs, and Features**

* Non-Staff members are not permitted to attempt to stop or punish other players who are breaking rules. You must use the /report \[id\] \[description of incident\] command and let Staff handle the situation.
  * This is regarded as interfering with staff and breaking this rule can result in up to a 72 hour temporary ban.
  * Example: A LEO jails a suspected modder or RDMer out of RP for an extended period of time. This is NOT allowed.
* You may encounter a bug with vehicle restriction permissions which allow you to spawn or drive all vehicles, only drive the ones you are normally allowed.
  * If you are found driving a vehicle that is normally restricted to you, it will lead to punishment.
* Do not disconnect to avoid punishment or evade staff members. This will result in a temporary ban or permanent ban depending on your actions.
* Abusing any loopholes found within the rules document are grounds for punishment, if you find a loophole, notify us via a ticket in the Noir Roleplay discord and we can discuss an amendment to the rules document.
* Exploiting a bug without reporting it to staff will result in an immediate ban, you can report an exploit by making a ticket on our discord. 

#### **Adult RP \(18+ ONLY\)**

* Sexual RP is allowed but only to some extent. Going overboard with it may lead to punishment and eventually a temporary ban or permanent ban, punishment is up to the staff member's discretion. Sexual RP must be done via the /do command, if you perform Sexual RP in Global Chat, it will result in a temporary ban or permanent ban, depending on severity.
* _DISCLAIMER: By taking part in sexual RP, you agree that you are of the age 18 or over and that Noir Roleplay takes no responsibility for your actions. This is in accordance with the age of consent and underage sex laws._

#### **Miscellaneous** 

* No combat logging.
* To use an Animal Ped you must ask an Admin for permission to do so. The Admin MUST be on the server.  Once the Admin leaves the server, you must stop using the Animal Ped or it will lead to punishment.
