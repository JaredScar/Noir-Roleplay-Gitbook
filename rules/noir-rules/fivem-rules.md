# FiveM Rules

#### **In-Game Actions**

* No VDM \(Vehicle Death Match\) or RDM \(Random Death Match\). Which is classified as unjustified RP based on the actions of others. You cannot just go up to a person and shoot them in the head or run them over with your car for fun.
  * Mass RDM/VDM are punishable by a 72 hour temporary ban or permanent ban depending on severity.
  * If you are being RDM’d or VDM’d, do NOT try to get revenge. Report the player and ignore them or you may be subject to the same punishment.
* No cop baiting. This means that if you are purposely doing an illegal activity in front of an LEO to get them to respond, it can lead to you being punished.  Think of a realistic way to start RP scenarios.
* Permanently killing a character MUST be agreed by BOTH parties.
* If you RP suicide using, for example, cyanide pills. Your character is permanently dead.
* Utilities that are not in the game such as flashbangs, smoke grenades, etc. cannot be used via /me or /do. 
* Terrorist RP is permitted but it must be tasteful.  Simply screaming racist slurs and blowing one's self up will not be tolerated.  If you would like to take the time to create a terrorist call, you may do so but you may not act on stereotypes for terrorism. Make sure your acts are well planned out and there are plenty of officers online to respond to any act you commit.
* RP as if you fear for your life. For example, if you are a hostage in a bank robbery, do what the “bad guy” asks.  Do not do anything that could lead to getting yourself killed unless it is something your character would actually do.
* You can only run from cops if you have an active warrant and/or valid reason.
  * Running from the cops for "going 5 over" is not a valid reason.
  * Running from the cops because you "felt like it" is also not a valid reason.
  * _Alternatively, if you would like to run from the cops without one of the reasons specified above, you may ask the cop in /ooc if he would like a 10-80. If he accepts, only then can you RP a 10-80 out without meeting the above criteria previously described._

#### **Restricted Areas/Locations**

* Gang headquarters may only be raided or taken over when the gang is active.
* Coast Guard and Military ships cannot be boarded if you are attempting a raid \(this applies to the USS Iowa. USS Missouri, and USS Fletcher\). Realistically, these ships would have a crew with thousands of members... We don't have that kind of population on the server sadly... You may attack the Military, but you cannot board the ship unless there are 5+ active Military personnel on the ship.
* Fort Zancudo cannot be entered if you are attempting a raid.  Realistically, this base would have thousands of Active Duty members… We don’t have that kind of population on the server sadly… You may attack the National Guard, but you cannot raid the base unless there are 5+ active National Guard members on the base.

#### **Abusing Permissions, Bugs, and Features**

* Non-Staff members are not permitted to attempt to stop or punish other players who are breaking rules. You must use the /report \[id\] \[description of incident\] command and let Staff handle the situation.
  * This is regarded as interfering with staff and breaking this rule can result in up to a 72 hour temporary ban.
  * Example: A LEO jails a suspected modder or RDMer out of RP for an extended period of time. This is NOT allowed.
* You may encounter a bug with vehicle restriction permissions which allow you to spawn or drive all vehicles, only drive the ones you are normally allowed.
  * If you are found driving a vehicle that is normally restricted to you, it will lead to punishment.
* Do not disconnect to avoid punishment or evade staff members. This will result in a temporary ban or permanent ban depending on your actions.
* Abusing any loopholes found within the rules document are grounds for punishment, if you find a loophole, notify us via a ticket in the Noir Roleplay discord and we can discuss an amendment to the rules document.

#### **Adult RP \(18+ ONLY\)**

* Sexual RP is allowed but only to some extent. Going overboard with it may lead to punishment and eventually a temporary ban or permanent ban, punishment is up to the staff member's discretion. Sexual RP must be done via the /do command, if you perform Sexual RP in Global Chat, it will result in a temporary ban or permanent ban, depending on severity.
* _DISCLAIMER: By taking part in sexual RP, you agree that you are of the age 18 or over and that Noir Roleplay takes no responsibility for your actions. This is in accordance with the age of consent and underage sex laws._

#### **Miscellaneous** 

* No combat logging.
* To use an Animal Ped you must ask an Admin for permission to do so. The Admin MUST be on the server.  Once the Admin leaves the server, you must stop using the Animal Ped or it will lead to punishment.
